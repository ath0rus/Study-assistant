# Study assistant
This is a free to use tool that uses a time based system to alarm you at several different times

## Requirements
This code was written in python 3.8.5 and should be compatibale with any sub versions of 3.8 and 3.9. You will also need to have win10toast module installed which is responsible for the notifications. This can be done by searching ```pip install win10toast``` in the windows search bar. if you need to isntall python or the ```pip install``` command fails make sure you have followed [this tutorial](https://github.com/ath0rus/Python-Tutorial/blob/master/Chapter-1-Setup/2-Installing-Python.md#installing-python)

## Notes and suggestions
To have this code work correctly you need to leave the code open and running in the background. There is no pause or memeory in this code at all and it will automatically cycle through the different times with no need to click on the notification. if the code is still running but you are note reciving noteifications check that focus assist has not turnt on as that will interupt the code.
